                                TASK 1 
For Task-1, I worked on a synthetic online orders dataset containing 500 records.
The dataset was created to simulate real-world e-commerce order data and includes customer details, order information, payment methods, and order status.

The dataset was loaded in CSV format and inspected to understand its structure, columns, and data types before performing any analysis or cleaning.
